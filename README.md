# Movie_Review_Classification

This project provided a focus around working with "Text Data" and more
specifically the sentiment analysis that can be conducted from text data. For
this study, our group looked at movie reviews from a polarity dataset from
cornell. In this dataset existed positive and negative movie reviews. The Python
library that was most essential for this assignment was scikit-learn. The data
was uploaded to Google Colab and sentiment analysis was coded using the
solution provided from scikit-learn. The next step was to gain understanding
of the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) that was used in
the sentiment analysis. The next problem focused on gaining understanding
of two different machine learning algorithms (Linear Classifier and K Nearest
Neighbors Classifier). These algorithms were run and their accuracies were
compared further. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm was also run
to classify the reviews, and its accuracies and runtimes were then compared using
different inputs. Lastly as a business problem, our group has looked into the
Stem Player that Kanye is releasing his newest album on. Using our algorithm
we wanted to gauge public sentiment on the idea of purchasing a Stem Player
device to listen to the album exclusively. After this we then went on to modify
a solution to Kanyeâ€™s idea and tap into this untouched market.
